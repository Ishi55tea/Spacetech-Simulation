        <p>Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, leaving a moving region of shadow on Earth's surface.
             Lunar eclipses occur when Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon.
             A total solar eclipse took place on Saturday, December 4, 2021, when the Moon passed between Earth and the Sun,
              thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. </p>
